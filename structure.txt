This website was what I was really looking for.
https://climbtheladder.com/10-python-folder-structure-best-practices/#:~:text=10%20Python%20Folder%20Structure%20Best%20Practices%201%201.,the%20PEP%208%20style%20guide%20...%20More%20items
 
 Principles:
 1) absolute imports to enforce modular programming
 2) avoid circular imports
 3) enable pep 8 styles guide (and prettier?)
 4) docstrings for all public modules, functions and classes
    a) quickly research the difference between functional and object oriented programming.
 5) readme file with instructions on how to run the program and the relevant info.
